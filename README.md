# Learning Assistant

**Learning Assistant** is a React app that uses **Gemini AI** to generate quizzes for users to test their knowledge on various topics.

> ⚠️ I know the code isn’t perfect, so I don't care for the moment.
> Could’ve used better practices like:

> - Using state management and custom hooks  
> - Making it responsive

> But the goal was speed — just get it built and working. Will refactor code in the future.
